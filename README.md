# WardenOS Source

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.9.

"WardenOS" is a toolkit developed for the Mothership TTRPG. It includes random table generators, two character builders to create random player characters or "biased" player characters: character classes, loadouts, and skills are chosen based on the randomly generated stats, and the ability to export the results of these generators as PDFs.
